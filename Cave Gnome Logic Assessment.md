Cave Gnome Logic Assessment:
=====

####How did they do this?

The logic problem does not state that they are the one applying the paint to themselves and says nothing about others being able to communicate to them. So, therefore, whoever put the paint on them could simply just tell them what color they and where to go and stand to create two groups

####How did you arrive at that answer? Show your process.

It specifically says in the puzzle that they are told to exit the cave and sort themselves, so clearly someone is talking and communicating to the gnomes. As someone can clearing talk to them, despite them not be allowed to talk, the person could have told them anything they wanted.

####What other possible answers are there?

* One other possible answer could be that they simply just chipped a piece of paint off their head after they exit and then see what color they are and walk into that group. Or since they were just painted the paint may still be wet and they just tap their head with something and see the color on that.

* They could have already been in 2 separate lines while being painted and have just continued to group up after exiting.

* Or they could have simply found a reflective surface, i.e. water or a mirror to determine their color.
