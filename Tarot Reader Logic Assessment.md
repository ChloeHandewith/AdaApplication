Tarot Reader Logic Assessment:
=============

####What were the weights of the cats?

The weights of the cats are, 2, 3 and 6 kilograms.

####How did you arrive at that answer? Show your process

I arrived at this answer by taking all available facts. The cats weights are multiples of 36, their weights add up to the price of a tarot card reading and one cat is distinctly smaller than the other two. By having their weights 2, 3 and 6, it both keeps the cats weights to a more reasonable level, while adding up to a definitely possible price for a tarot card reading.

####What other possible answers are there?

* Other possible weights could be, 1, 6 and 6. Making one cat drastically smaller than the other two, giving Bookis a more likely chance to immediately know the weights of all three. The cats are also stated to be prized cats, so it would be reasonable to assume that the tarot card reader would take excellent care of them, which could keep their weights at more similar levels.

* Another set of weights could be, 9, 4 and 1. Again making one cat distinctly smaller, however this answer makes one cat a significantly larger, possibly beyond the level of an average cat.
